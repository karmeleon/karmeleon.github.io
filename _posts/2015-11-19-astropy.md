I'm currently enrolled in Astronomy 499 at UIUC, and for the final project my group decided to investigate the effects of [adaptive optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_optics) on images taken on our telescopes. The writeup, raw data, and generated graphs are available on [the repo](https://github.com/karmeleon/AstroImageAnalysis). The code is really slow, but it's also very readable and should be easy to modify if you ever find yourself analyzing pictures of stars, but for some reason don't want to use a more professional tool.
