title: I take games way too seriously
---

So, I'm bad at Solitaire. Like, [_really bad_](https://imgur.com/3ErkH5f). However, I'm good at writing code and just took an algorithms course this semester, so one afternoon I decided to make up for my complete lack of card game strategy with brute force. About twelve hours later, I had a semi-working Klondike generator and solver. Unfortunately, I've never actually seen it solve a game other than the one I specifically made to be as easy as possible to solve. I'm sure I'm just missing something small. It uses a thread-safe priority queue and multiple threads so it's pretty fast, at least. Hopefully I'll be able to fix it soon and post an update.

On a related note, it's almost the 25^th birthday of Windows 3.0, the first version of Windows to include the familiar card game. Happy birthday, you dinosaur.
