title: Site upgrades!

All posts now have Disqus comment integration, so the few visitors this site has who aren't Russian bots can weigh in on my coding escapades. There's also pagination since I have over five posts now, and even [an RSS feed](/feed.xml)! I've never seen a person actually use RSS in my life, but it's there.
