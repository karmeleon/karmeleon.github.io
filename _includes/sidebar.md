About
=====

This is a blog I made to talk about programming type things that I find or write. If you find the stuff here interesting, feel free to [shoot me an email](smwalto2@illinois.edu) or [take a look at my resum√©](/assets/resume.pdf)! There are a few older things on [my Github](https://github.com/shawnwalton) that I haven't written about, so you might as well go check that out too.
