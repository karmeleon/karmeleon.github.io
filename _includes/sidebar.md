About

This is a blog I made to talk about programming type things that I find or write. If you find the stuff here interesting, feel free to  shoot me an email at <smwalto2@illinois.edu> or take a look at [my resum√©](/assets/resume.html) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=317184116)! There are a few older things on [my Github](https://github.com/karmeleon) that I haven't written about, so you might as well go check that out too.
